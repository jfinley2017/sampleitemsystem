# sampleitemsystem

The foundation for an item system used by Predecessor (images taken from their pre-alpha gameplay in october 2020)

This system supports the attribute system provided by the GameplayAbilitySystem, as well as plug ins for granting abilities (though that is not enabled here).

Supports items being displayed by trees, as popular in the MOBA genre, although UI elements have been ommitted from this sample. The UI shown in the screenshot was influenced by my initial
UI, though the team went on to make stylistic changes and added category sections to the items (starting items, midgame items, etc).
